# Welcome to ChipperFluff! ðŸŽ®ðŸ‘¾

Hey there! We're ChipperFluff, a kinda chaotic but totally fun crew who loves dabbling in games, Windows apps, Telegram & Discord bots, and web apps. We don't always know what we're doing, but we always make it awesome!

## Whatâ€™s Our Jam?

So, we make stuff:
- **Games**: Cool, quirky, sometimes glitchy but always fun!
- **Windows Apps**: We throw stuff at the wall, see what sticks.
- **Bots for Telegram & Discord**: Making your chats weirdly more interesting.
- **Web Applications**: Yeah, they work... most of the time!

## Stuff We Made

### Stuff We're Messing With Now
- **Simple Sudoku**: A Sudoku playground with puzzles you can solve, create, and customize.
- **Urban Hitman**: Satirical scoring on urban landscapes. It's mischievously fun!
- **EventBot**: Your Telegram sidekick for slick event management.

### Stuff We Dream About Making
**nothing at the momment... were working on our dreams already**
but u can suggest future stuff ^^

## The Squad

### Our Team
Oh, just a bunch of cool furs who thought itâ€™d be fun to make digital stuff:
- **Dominik "ChipperFluff"**: Squirrel coding extraordinaire, bouncing through code and the furry world with unmatched zest.

And like, a bunch more folks who wander in and out.
